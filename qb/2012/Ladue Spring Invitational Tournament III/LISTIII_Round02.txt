answer: "The <strong><u>Raven</u></strong>"

<strong>This poem's narrator asks "is there balm in Gilead?" before telling the title entity to "get thee back into the tempest and night's Plutonian shore!" That narrator's "quaint and curious volumes" "surcease" him of sorrow for "the rare and radiant maiden"</strong> (*) Lenore. This poem's title creature sat "upon a pallid bust of Pallas just above" the chamber door it had earlier gently rapped and tapped upon. Beginning "Once upon a midnight dreary" while the narrator "pondered weak and weary," for ten points, identify this Edgar Allan Poe poem whose title bird keeps repeating "Nevermore."
